To build the library "libtioga.a"
---------------------------------
[user@machine tioga]$ cd src;make;cd ..

To build the tools for standalone testing
----------------------------
[user@machine tioga]$ cd driver;make;cd ..
[user@machine tioga]$ cd gridGen;make;cd ..

To run the test the case
---------------------------
[user@machine tioga]$ cd case;./run.sh 16

run.sh does two things:

1. builds a sample grid system that is composed of
   a prizmatic sphere grid and a background hex grid 
   The argument "16" above says how many cores you want
   to test this problem.

2. performs connectivity using tioga and verifies that
   the interpolation accuracy for a linear field

To visualize
---------------------
[user@machine tioga/case]$ tec360 iblank.lay

NOTE:
I use intel fortran for f90 and gcc/g++ for C/C++
the build system is setup for that. If you use another
compiler change the FFLAGS in various Makefiles to match
the flags you need to use. I have tested with gfortran and
it seems to work OK
